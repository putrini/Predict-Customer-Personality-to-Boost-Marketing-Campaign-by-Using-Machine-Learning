# Predict-Customer-Personality-to-Boost-Marketing-Campaign-by-Using-Machine-Learning
## Overview
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. For organizations overflowing with data but struggling to turn it into useful insights, machine learning can provide the solution to analyze and make data-driven recommendations and decisions. Businesses use machine learning to recognize patterns and then make predictions about what will appeal to customers, improve operations, or help make a product better.

Customer segmentation is the process by which you divide your customers up based on common characteristics such as behaviors, so you can market to those customers more effectively.
