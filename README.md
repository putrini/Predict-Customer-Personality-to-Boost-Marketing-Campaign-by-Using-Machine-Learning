# Predict-Customer-Personality-to-Boost-Marketing-Campaign-by-Using-Machine-Learning
## Overview
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. For organizations overflowing with data but struggling to turn it into useful insights, machine learning can provide the solution to analyze and make data-driven recommendations and decisions. Businesses use machine learning to recognize patterns and then make predictions about what will appeal to customers, improve operations, or help make a product better. 

One of the applications of machine learning for enhancing business is customer segmentation. Customer segmentation is the process by which you divide your customers up based on common characteristics such as behaviors, so you can market to those customers more effectively. By better understanding the customer, and therefore being able to target them more effectively to generate insights that will boost marketing campaign. 

In this paper we will implement the machine learning model to identify customer profile and behavior.
## Summary
This project aims to identify customer profiles and behavior such as total spending, income, purchasing activities which affecting the marketing campaign using Machine Learning. In this project, Kmeans clustering model is chosen to do customer segmentation. The results shows that customer is divided into 3 clusters based on their income and total spend amount which are low spender, mid spender and high spender. Based on customer behavior analysis, market retargeting is focused to mid spender and high spender group who have more potential to earn higher GMV.
## Tools
Tools used in this project is Python as programming language, Google collaboratory as the tools and python library used are Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, StandardScaler, Kmeans, Silhouette score.
## Dataset
The dataset is using marketing campaign dataset from [here](https://bit.ly/datasetDS_MP3).
